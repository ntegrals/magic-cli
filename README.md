## Installation

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

1. Get an OpenAI API Key at [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)

   ‚ùóÔ∏è By default the model uses GPT-4. If you don't have access to GPT-4 yet, you have to use the --gpt3 flag. (It will then use the GPT-3.5 Turbo model)

2. Install the CLI via npm
   ```sh
   npm install -g thanksgpt
   ```
3. The CLI can then simply be called by running:
   ```
   thanksgpt
   ```
   or
   ```
   thanks
   ```
   I'm going to use the latter in the following examples for the sake of brevity.
4. Add your OpenAI API key (It's only stored on your device)
   ```sh
   thanks -ak "sk-9jfoa..."
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Examples

### 1. Self-Repair a Python file

Run the thanks command in a directory with a file called `test.py`:

```sh
  thanks -f test.py python3
```

This command will run the file `test.py` with the interpreter `python3` and automatically try to fix it when it crashes or has a bug.

### 2. Translate from Python to TypeScript

Run the thanks command in a directory with a file called `test.py`. We also need to specify a file that we want to write to `test.ts` in this case (If not the CLI will only log to the console). Now Thanks GPT will automatically translate the code to TypeScript.

```sh
  thanks -l test.py TypeScript -o test.ts
```

### 3. Conduct a code review

Run the thanks command in a directory with a file called `test.py`. In this case we might only want to view the output in the terminal, so we don't need to specify an output file. This command will review the code and give you feedback on how to improve it.

```sh
  thanks -r test.py
```

### 4. Generate unit tests

Run the thanks command in a directory with a file called `hello.ts` with the testing framework that we want to use (Jest in this case). We also need to specify the file that we want to write to `hello.test.ts`. Now Thanks GPT will automatically generate unit tests for the code.

```sh
  thanks -t hello.ts Jest -o hello.test.ts
```
