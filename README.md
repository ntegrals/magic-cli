## Installation

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

1. Get an OpenAI API Key at [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)

   By default the model uses GPT-4.

   If you don't have access to GPT-4 yet, you have to use the --gpt3 flag. Magic GPT is much more powerful with GPT-4.

2. Install the CLI via npm
   ```sh
   npm install -g magicgpt
   ```
3. To verify that the installation worked, run:
   ```
   magic
   ```
4. Add your OpenAI API key (It's only stored on your device)
   ```sh
   magic -ak "sk-9jfoa..."
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Examples

### 1. Self-Repair a Python file

Run the magic command in a directory with a file called `test.py`:

```sh
  magic -f test.py python3
```

This command will run the file `test.py` with the interpreter `python3` and automatically try to fix it when it crashes or has a bug.

### 2. Translate from Python to TypeScript

Run the magic command in a directory with a file called `test.py`. We also need to specify a file that we want to write to `test.ts` in this case (If not the CLI will only log to the console). Now Magic GPT will automatically translate the code to TypeScript.

```sh
  magic -l test.py TypeScript -o test.ts
```

### 3. Conduct a code review

Run the magic command in a directory with a file called `test.py`. In this case we might only want to view the output in the terminal, so we don't need to specify an output file. This command will review the code and give you feedback on how to improve it.

```sh
  magic -r test.py
```

### 4. Generate unit tests

Run the magic command in a directory with a file called `hello.ts` with the testing framework that we want to use (Jest in this case). We also need to specify the file that we want to write to `hello.test.ts`. Now Magic GPT will automatically generate unit tests for the code.

```sh
  magic -t hello.ts Jest -o hello.test.ts
```
