    ðŸŸ¨ Add new feature                  [Adds a new feature based on an input file]
    ðŸŸ¨ Increase context window          [Increase context window with vector embeddings]
    ðŸŸ¨ Process directories              [CLI can process directories and not only files]
    ðŸŸ¨ Provide examples                 [User can provide examples to better guide GPT-4]

## Installation

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

1. Get an OpenAI API Key at [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)

   By default the model uses GPT-4.

   If you don't have access to GPT-4 yet, you have to use the --gpt3 flag. Magic GPT is much more powerful with GPT-4.

2. Install the CLI via npm
   ```sh
   npm install -g magicgpt
   ```
3. Add your OpenAI API key (It's only stored on your device)
   ```sh
   magic -ak "sk-9jfoa..."
   ```

To verify that the installation worked, run:

```
magic
```
