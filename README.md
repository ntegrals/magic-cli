## Installation

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

1. Get an OpenAI API Key at [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)

   To do so...

   By default the model uses GPT-3.5...

   Optionally, you can request access to the GPT-4 API. The Magic CLI is much more powerful with GPT-4.

2. Install the CLI via npm
   ```sh
   npm install -g magic-cli
   ```
3. Add your OpenAI API key (It's only stored on your device)
   ```sh
   magic-cli -ak "sk-9jfoa..."
   ```

To verify that the installation worked, run:

```
magic-cli
```
